New backend merge with my authentication code appears to just work,
both with old frontend and with new frontend. Backend needs the auth
database, of course, which we have on the test server.

The goal is to enable HTTP Basic Authentication on a development Korp
in Mets√§talo and Martin's work on Shibboleth Authentication on the
production Korp (and test Korp) at CSC.

(1) korp.cgi returns username as part of authentication to the
    frontend: { 'username' : <string>, 'corpora' : <strings> } if
    authenticated, { 'username' : None } otherwise.

(2) korp.cgi passes to AUTH_SERVER

    - cgi.os.environ['REMOTE_USER'] as remote_user if available
      (Shibboleth, trusted)

    - form['username'] and form['password'] as username and password
      as now, otherwise (HTTP Basic Authentication)

(3) korp.cgi uses a database in place of PROTECTED_FILE to get the
    list of corpora that require authentication (ACA and RES); our
    development AUTH_SERVER uses the database for further
    authentication and authorization and comes with a corresponding
    maintenance tool; CSC will connect to a real user management
    system.

There are also older changes by Jyrki to encode problematic characters
in search results or something like that.

We've learned a couple of things: the web server may need configuring
to pass on the HTTP Authorization header (Korp expects to have it in
the environment variable HTTP_AUTH_HEADER; a mongoose put it in
HTTP_AUTHORIZATION instead, and an apache, nowehere by default);
SELinux may need configuring to allow httpd to use HTTP (else any
attempt to open AUTH_SERVER would fail with Permission Denied).
